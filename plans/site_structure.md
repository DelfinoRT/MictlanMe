# Pokémon REST Academy - Site Structure

## Overall Structure
The site will be organized into tracks and chapters, with a playful Pokémon theme. Below is the proposed structure:

### Top-Level Sections
1. **Home**: Introduction to the academy, what learners will achieve, and why Pokémon + APIs are cool.
2. **Track 1 – Web & HTTP Basics**: Foundational concepts like URLs, HTTP requests/responses, and JSON.
3. **Track 2 – REST & Resources**: REST concepts, resources, endpoints, and HTTP methods.
4. **Track 3 – Working with PokéAPI**: Hands-on exercises and labs using PokéAPI.
5. **Track 4 – Mini Projects**: Guided projects to build small applications like a Pokédex or evolution viewer.
6. **Toolbox**: Links to tools like browser DevTools, Postman, Insomnia, and curl.

### Navigation
- A navigation bar at the top will link to each track and the toolbox.
- Each track will have a sidebar for easy navigation between lessons.
- A "Next Lesson" button at the end of each lesson to guide learners through the content.
